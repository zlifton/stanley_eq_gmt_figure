# stanley_eq_gmt_figure

Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) script for mapping the 2020 M6.5 Stanley earthquake, aftershocks, and InSAR interferogram. This figure was modified slightly in Adobe Illustrator and used in the following publication:

  Liberty, L.M, Lifton, Z.M., and Mikesell, T.D., (2020) The 31 March 2020 Mw 6.5 Stanley, Idaho, Earthquake: Seismotectonics and Preliminary Aftershock Analysis: Seismological Research Letters, https://doi.org/10.1785/0220200319.
